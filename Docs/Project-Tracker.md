# Project Tracker: Spring PetClinic DevOps Integration

This document tracks the high-level tasks for implementing a full CI/CD pipeline for the Spring PetClinic application.

## To Do

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundational Setup & CI**
  - [ ] Formalize Git branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow)
  - [ ] Enhance CI pipeline with code quality gates (SonarQube)
  - [ ] Configure artifact repository (e.g., Nexus/Artifactory) for JARs
- [ ] **Phase 2: Containerization & Registry**
  - [ ] Set up a cloud container registry (e.g., AWS ECR)
  - [ ] Add automated Docker image push to CI pipeline
- [ ] **Phase 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
  - [ ] Write Terraform/CloudFormation scripts for a Kubernetes cluster
  - [ ] Write IaC for a managed database (e.g., AWS RDS)
  - [ ] Implement secrets management for database credentials
- [ ] **Phase 4: Continuous Deployment (CD)**
  - [ ] Create a separate CD workflow in GitHub Actions
  - [ ] Use Kustomize to manage environment-specific Kubernetes manifests
  - [ ] Automate deployment to the Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] **Phase 5: Monitoring & Observability**
  - [ ] Deploy Prometheus and Grafana to the cluster
  - [ ] Set up a log aggregation stack (e.g., EFK)
  - [ ] Configure alerting for critical application issues

## In Progress

- [ ] Enhance CI pipeline with code quality gates (SonarQube)

## Done

- [x] **Initial Analysis & Planning**
  - [x] Analyzed codebase for CI/CD feasibility and created `gemini-analysis-report.md`.
  - [x] Visualized the target architecture with `cicd_architecture.png`.
  - [x] Created project tracking and roadmap documents.
- [x] **Git Workflow Implementation**
  - [x] Formalize Git branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow)
