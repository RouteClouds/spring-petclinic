Yes - Please Proceed to Task 1 (Idempotency) by analyzing the provided audit report path?
I think that we are good with the main which is primary branch - Do you want the Ansible and recovery stages to run on both main and develop or only on main?
Yes for all four - Should I implement ALB ingress for all four UIs (Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanager, ArgoCD) with TLS and basic auth where applicable?
