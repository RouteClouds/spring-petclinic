# DevOps Roadmap for Spring PetClinic Deployment

This document outlines the step-by-step process for taking the Spring PetClinic application from its current state to a fully automated, production-grade deployment using modern DevOps practices.

### **Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Continuous Integration (CI)**

*Goal: Solidify the build and test process, ensuring every code change is automatically validated.*

1.  **Formalize Branching Strategy**: Adopt a standard Git branching model like GitFlow. This typically involves `main` for production releases, `develop` for the latest integrated changes, and `feature/*` branches for new work.
2.  **Enhance CI Pipeline**: Review the existing GitHub Actions workflow (`maven-build.yml`).
    *   Ensure it triggers on all relevant branches (pull requests to `develop` and `main`).
    *   Add a step for static code analysis using a tool like **SonarQube** to catch bugs and security vulnerabilities early.
3.  **Secure a Build Tool**: Standardize on either Maven or Gradle for all CI/CD operations. The existing `./mvnw verify` is a perfect command for this phase as it compiles, runs tests, and packages the app.
4.  **(Optional) Publish JAR Artifact**: Configure the CI pipeline to publish the packaged `.jar` file to an artifact repository like **JFrog Artifactory** or **Sonatype Nexus**. This provides versioned, stable builds for rollbacks or manual distribution.

### **Phase 2: Containerization & Registry**

*Goal: Package the application into a portable container and store it in a secure, centralized registry.*

1.  **Automate Image Build**: Add a new step to the CI workflow that runs after successful testing. Use the built-in Spring Boot command to create an OCI-compliant image:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=your-registry/petclinic:${GITHUB_SHA}
    ```
2.  **Set Up Container Registry**: Provision a private container registry. **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** is a common choice when deploying to AWS.
3.  **Automate Image Push**: Configure the CI workflow to authenticate with the container registry (using GitHub Secrets for credentials) and push the newly built image. This should only happen on successful merges to the `develop` or `main` branch.

---

### **Phase 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

*Goal: Define all necessary cloud infrastructure in code for repeatable, automated environment creation.*

1.  **Provision Kubernetes Cluster**: Use an IaC tool like **Terraform** or **AWS CloudFormation** to define and create a managed Kubernetes cluster (e.g., **Amazon EKS**). This code should specify the cluster version, node sizes, and networking.
2.  **Provision Managed Database**: Use the same IaC tool to provision a managed PostgreSQL or MySQL database (e.g., **Amazon RDS**). This separates the database from the application cluster, which is a best practice.
3.  **Implement Secrets Management**: Store the database URL, username, and password securely. Use **Kubernetes Secrets** (managed by your IaC) or a dedicated tool like **HashiCorp Vault**. The application will consume these secrets as environment variables at runtime.

---

### **Phase 4: Continuous Deployment (CD)**

*Goal: Automate the release of the containerized application to the Kubernetes cluster.*

1.  **Create CD Workflow**: In GitHub Actions, create a new workflow that triggers after the CI workflow successfully builds and pushes an image from the `main` branch.
2.  **Manage Manifests with Kustomize**: The `k8s/` directory contains base manifests. Use **Kustomize** to manage environment-specific configurations without duplicating files. For example, Kustomize can be used to patch the `deployment.yml` with the correct image tag for the new release.
3.  **Automate Deployment**: The CD workflow will use `kubectl` to apply the Kustomize-generated manifests to the Kubernetes cluster.
    ```bash
    # Authenticate with the cluster
    # ...
    # Apply the manifests
    kustomize build overlays/production | kubectl apply -f -
    ```
4.  **Ensure Zero-Downtime Updates**: Configure the Kubernetes `Deployment` object with a `RollingUpdate` strategy and define `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe` endpoints (leveraging Spring Boot Actuator's `/health` endpoints). This ensures the old version is not terminated until the new version is ready to serve traffic.

---

### **Phase 5: Monitoring & Observability**

*Goal: Gain deep insight into the application's performance and health in production.*

1.  **Metrics Collection**: Deploy **Prometheus** into the cluster to automatically scrape metrics from the Spring Boot Actuator's `/prometheus` endpoint.
2.  **Visualization**: Deploy **Grafana** and configure it with Prometheus as a data source. Create dashboards to visualize key application metrics (e.g., JVM performance, HTTP request latency, error rates).
3.  **Log Aggregation**: Set up a cluster-wide logging stack, such as **Fluentd**, **Elasticsearch**, and **Kibana (EFK)**, to collect, store, and search application logs from all running pods.
4.  **Alerting**: Configure **Alertmanager** (part of the Prometheus ecosystem) to send alerts to email, Slack, or PagerDuty when critical thresholds are breached (e.g., high CPU usage, low disk space, application error spikes).
