## Gemini Memory Note - September 3, 2025

**Project:** Spring PetClinic DevOps Integration
**Overall Goal:** Implement a full CI/CD pipeline for the Spring PetClinic application.

**Current Status:**
*   **Phase 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
    *   **What's Done:**
        *   Phase 1 (Foundational Setup & CI - SonarQube temporarily disabled) is complete.
        *   Phase 2 (Containerization & Registry - Docker build/push to ECR) is complete.
        *   Terraform code for AWS (VPC, EKS cluster, RDS PostgreSQL) has been fully generated and placed in the `terraform/` directory.

**Next Action Item (User's Responsibility):**
*   The project has been prepared for transfer to another system.
*   On the new system, navigate to the project root (`/home/ubuntu/Projects/spring-petclinic/`).
*   Execute the Terraform commands (`terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`) from within the `terraform/` directory to provision the AWS infrastructure.

**My Next Action (Once User Confirms Terraform Apply Success on New System):**
*   Proceed with **Phase 4: Continuous Deployment (CD)**.
    *   This will involve creating Kubernetes deployment manifests for the PetClinic application.
    *   Setting up the CD pipeline in GitHub Actions to deploy to the newly provisioned EKS cluster.
